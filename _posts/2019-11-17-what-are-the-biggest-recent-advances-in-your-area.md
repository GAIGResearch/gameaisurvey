### What are the biggest recent advances in your area?


* Recent performance in Statistical Forward Planning (Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms, Monte Carlo Tree Search)
* Deep Learning
* Deep Reinforcement Learning
* Alphago (expert iteration framework)
* Alphazero (MCTS + Deep CNNs + RL) 
* Aalphastar (population based training + DRL, self-play)
* DeepMimic
* Pluribus (Counter factual regret minimization)

* Successfully playing video games with intrinsic motivation alone
* Better scalability of intrinsic motivation models based on deep RL, making them more employable in commercial games.
