### What are the biggest recent advances in your area?

* Deep RL, recent performance in SFP
* PCGML, Rolling Horizon search
* Successfully playing video games with intrinsic motivation alone
* Better scalability of intrinsic motivation models based on deep RL, making them more employable in commercial games.
* Generative Adversarial Networks for content generation
* Forward Model Learning
* I'm very interested in general agents, thus I think that DQN is still the biggest recent step in this direction, event though there are many other advancements that have occurred in sub-problems related to the field.
* Go-Explore: a New Approach for Hard-Exploration Problems by Ecoffet et al, The movement towards quality-diversity, The movement towards PCGML in general.
* Alphazero (MCTS + Deep CNNs + RL) /alphastar (population based training + DRL)
* Deep Learning
* DeepMimic
* AlphaZero, the solving of Limit and No limit Poker.
* Pluribus (Counter factual regret minimization), Alphago (expert iteration framework) and AlphaStar (self-play)
* The development of a native Unity plugin to perform supervised learning on sensor input data to create more expressive sensor game interactions.
* Deep reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks
* In my opinion, it is to have convinced the industry that academic research can be useful.
* MCTS, AlphaZero
