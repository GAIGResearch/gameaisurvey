### What are the most important open challenges?

* Open-ended action spaces
* Large action spaces
* Large numbers of agents
* Multi-agent partially observable games
* Synthesizing complex movements for humanoid characters
* Learning general behavior
* Hierarchical reasoning
* Strategy learning for general games
* Explainable AI

* Optimal RL: Generalization, transfer learning, sample efficiency, multi-task, model-based, etc.
* Sample efficiency of RL methods, high variance and robustness to underlying environment changes
* Learning with a few samples and transfer learning

* Learning world models
* Learning forward model abstractions

* Content evaluation
* Evaluating computational creativity applications
* How to get software to write software in creative ways that supplement human coders - this will revolutionise game design (and a lot of other areas)
* Creating AI-assisted designers that actually collaborate with humans
* Procedural content generation for commercial games

* How the use of machine learning models to customise game control schemes can affect the player experience
