### What are the most important open challenges?

* Learning world models, dealing with open-ended action spaces, large numbers of agents
* Content evaluation
* Evaluating computational creativity applications, e.g. PCG in games
* How to get software to write software in creative ways that supplement human coders - this will revolutionise game design (and a lot of other areas)
* Forward Model Learning and Abstraction, Multi-agent partially observable games, AI for games with huge action spaces
* Almost every aspect in RL is very suboptimal: Generalization, transfer learning, sample efficiency, multi-task, model-based, etc.
* Learning general behavior. Creating AI-assisted designers that actually collaborate with humans.
* Synthesizing complex movements for humanoid characters
* Hierarchical reasoning
* Sample efficiency of RL methods, high variance and robustness to  underlying environment changes
* We don't know yet how this tool can be used and how the use of machine learning models to customise game control schemes can affect the player experience.
* Learning with a few samples and transfer learning
* Procedural content generation for commercial games.
* Strategy learning for general games, strategy explanation
* The lack of proper attribution and development of Junior researchers due to a massive cultural problem in the leading elements of the game's units who are busy creating star chambers and secret planning commissions - I would highlight Santa Cruz, Queens, and NYU as problems in this field with their respective heads locking other units out of projects, stealing from people, and taking over conferences planning.
