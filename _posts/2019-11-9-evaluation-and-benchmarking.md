### Evaluation and Benchmarking (e.g. Atari Learning Environment, OpenAI Gym, GVGAI)

* GVGAI - [<a href='http://www.gvgai.net/'>url</a>]
* OpenAI Gym and games one can find on Github and that have been adapted to work with OpenAI Gym (e.g. Mario, Zelda, etc)
* GVGAI (biased answer)
* GVGAI, GDL
* Toribash
* FightingICE
* ALE (Atari Learning environment)
* I have created benchmarks for pathfinding that are broadly used: [<a href='http://movingai.com/benchmarks/'>url</a>]
