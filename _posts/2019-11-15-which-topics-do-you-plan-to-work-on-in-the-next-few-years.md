### Which topics do you plan to work on in the next few years?

* Applying game AI to real-world decision making
* Content evaluation, general game design
* Intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning in video game AI
* See ""most important open challenges""!
* Statistical Forward Planning methods for complex games
* Goal based RL, self-supervised RL, alternatives to RL to model learning and inferential processes in agents (e.g. free energy principle, empowerment).
* All of the above.
* Puzzle generation/solving
* Physically-based animation
* Hierarchical reasoning
* Mutiagent self-play reinforcement learning
* User studies looking at the effect on player experience when customising sensor-based controls in virtual reality.
* Personalized games with AI for health
* The definition of Game description languages and the development of commercial serious games.
* Feature learning for MCTS, game reconstruction from partial evidence, strategy explanation
* None of your business.
