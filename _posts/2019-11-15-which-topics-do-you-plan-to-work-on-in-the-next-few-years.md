### Which topics do you plan to work on in the next few years?

* Applying game AI to real-world decision making
* Hierarchical reasoning
* Game reconstruction from partial evidence
* Strategy explanation
* Statistical Forward Planning methods for complex games
* Feature learning for MCTS
* Intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning in video game AI
* Goal based RL
* Self-supervised RL
* Mutiagent self-play reinforcement learning

* Alternatives to RL for model learning and inferential processes in agents (e.g. free energy principle, empowerment).

* Content evaluation
* General game design
* Puzzle generation/solving

* Physically-based animation
* User studies looking at the effect on player experience when customising sensor-based controls in virtual reality
* Personalized games with AI for health
* The definition of game description languages and the development of commercial serious games.
