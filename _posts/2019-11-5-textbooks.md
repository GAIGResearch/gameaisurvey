### Textbooks

* PCGBook, Artificial Intelligence and Games (Togelius)
* Forthcoming GVGAI Textbook
* Yannakakis and Togelius, Game AI Book - [<a href='http://gameaibook.org/'>url</a>]
* Shaker et al, PCG Book - [<a href='http://pcgbook.com/'>url</a>]

* I'm not going to answer Yannakakis and Togelius (2018). That would be cheating.
* I like the following textbooks: Winning Ways; Lessons in Play
* I also like Demaine and Hearn's ""Games, Puzzles, and Computation"" which is not quite a textbook, but a relevant book nonetheless.
* Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction
* Artificial Intelligence: a modern approach
* Artificial Intelligence and Games ([<a href='http://gameaibook.org/'>url</a>])
