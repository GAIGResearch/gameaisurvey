Game AI Survey ran by Simon Lucas from the Game AI Group at Queen Mary University of London.

<br/><br/>
The aim is to capture a range of useful data from people working in Game AI.  We hope to gather a comprehensive range of useful resources, and also gain a clearer idea of the proportions of people working in each sub-area (the topic list is taken from "A Panorama of Artificial and Computational Intelligence in Games" by Yannakakis and Togelius, IEEE TCIAIG (2014))

<br/><br/>
The survey is designed to take around 15 - 20 minutes to complete.  In each case weâ€™ll get most value from these if you can provide a few hyperlinks for each resource type, and a brief (e.g. one-line) comment for each link.  Feel free to structure them by topic or not, and include your favourite resources, including the ones you authored.  Leave fields blank if you don't want to fill them out.  Each text field apart from Name and Affiliation is a text area; please leave blank lines to separate each item.

<br/><br/>
The information you provide may be shared, analysed and copied in a variety of ways.  

<br/><br/>
The intention is to publish the results of the survey, but this will only be meaningful if enough people take it.

<br/><br/>
Thank you for taking the survey!
